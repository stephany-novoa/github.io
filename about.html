        <p>Hi, I'm Stephany — a passionate and pragmatic data scientist with a love for turning complex data into meaningful solutions. I started my journey in mathematics and statistics, and over the past 9+ years, I've evolved into a full-stack data scientist working across industries, from government to gaming to home services. My goal has always been to bridge the gap between technical insights and strategic action.</p>

        <p>I thrive in environments where I can collaborate across disciplines, bring clarity to chaos, and deliver AI/ML tools that make a real difference. Whether I’m leading a team, automating workflows, or deploying models in production, I focus on building with intention and empathy.</p>

        <p>Outside of work, I’m a published author, a lifelong learner, and someone who loves exploring the intersection of creativity and logic. I'm currently based in Sanford, Florida, where I enjoy writing, solving problems, and mentoring others on their data journey.</p>

        <p>My professional experiences have shaped my approach to data — each role taught me something new. At Design Interactive, I pushed the boundaries of GenAI by building a hybrid recommendation engine and segmentation pipelines. At Sure Secure, I strengthened my understanding of secure AI design while leading cross-functional teams and presenting to federal stakeholders. My time at ARS showed me the power of predictive modeling in business strategy, delivering tangible sales impact with classification and forecasting models. Across all of these, I’ve learned that empathy, adaptability, and curiosity are as valuable as any technical skill.</p>
