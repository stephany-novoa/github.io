    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>Hi, I'm Stephany — a passionate and pragmatic data scientist with a love for turning complex data into meaningful solutions. I started my journey in mathematics and statistics, and over the past 9+ years, I've evolved into a full-stack data scientist working across industries, from government to gaming to home services. My goal has always been to bridge the gap between technical insights and strategic action.</p>

    <p>I thrive in environments where I can collaborate across disciplines, bring clarity to chaos, and deliver AI/ML tools that make a real difference. Whether I’m leading a team, automating workflows, or deploying models in production, I focus on building with intention and empathy.</p>

    <p>Outside of work, I’m a published author, a lifelong learner, and someone who loves exploring the intersection of creativity and logic. I'm currently based in Sanford, Florida, where I enjoy writing, solving problems, and mentoring others on their data journey.</p>
