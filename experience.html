    <div class="experience-entry">
      <h3>Florida Blue — Data Scientist</h3>
      <h4>2019 – 20121</h4>
      <p>At Florida Blue, I led several initiatives supporting Medicare compliance, member retention, and reporting automation. My work directly impacted cost savings, regulatory alignment, and proactive care management through robust analytics, automation, and stakeholder collaboration.</p>
      
     <h4>Project 1: Comorbidity Analysis for CMS Risk Adjustment</h4>
      <ul class="project-1">
        <li>Took ownership of a statistical analysis project aimed at evaluating whether patients with a BMI of 35–39.9 had meaningfully different comorbidity profiles than those with a BMI of 40+. This analysis was critical in guiding internal policy decisions and reimbursement strategies.</li>
        <li>Used hypothesis testing and distribution analysis to demonstrate that both groups shared similar health risk patterns, meaning they should be evaluated the same under CMS rules.</li>
        <li>The results provided a data-driven narrative the team could use to advocate for fairer risk adjustments, with direct implications on how patients are categorized and reimbursed under Medicare guidelines.</li>
      </ul>
    <h4>Project 2: Medicare Member Retention Model</h4>
      <ul class="project-2">
        <li>Designed a machine learning model using XGBoost to predict which Medicare Advantage members were most likely to leave within the next 12 months — a high-stakes window, since CMS stops reimbursement if a patient exits before that period.</li>
        <li>Worked closely with business stakeholders to define the modeling objective around minimizing false negatives, ensuring that high-risk members wouldn’t be missed by the system and could be prioritized for outreach.</li>
        <li>Collaborated with operational teams to integrate model outputs into member engagement workflows, helping reduce avoidable churn and improve compliance.</li>
      </ul>
    <h4>Project 3: Reporting Automation & Power BI Transition</h4>
      <ul class="project-3">
        <li>Inherited a number of cumbersome, Excel-heavy reports that required hours of manual updates each week. Recognizing the inefficiency, I rebuilt them from the ground up using SAS automation and embedded calculations.</li>
        <li>One of the most time-consuming reports went from taking a full day to compile to running automatically in minutes — reducing time spent by over 80% while increasing reliability.</li>
        <li>Introduced Power BI dashboards to visualize what was previously trapped in spreadsheets. This allowed stakeholders to interact with the data in real time, spot issues earlier, and explore performance trends without needing analysts to walk them through it.</li>
      </ul>
    <h4>Project 4: Regulatory Context and Stakeholder Communication</h4>
      <ul class="project-3">
        <li>Throughout every project, I developed a strong understanding of CMS policy frameworks, CPT codes, and HCC mappings to make sure all analyses were compliant and aligned with federal guidelines.</li>
        <li>Collaborated across analytics, compliance, operations, and leadership, adjusting how I presented data depending on the audience — from deep-dive technical reviews to high-level storytelling for executives</li>
        <li>I became known on the team as someone who could not only solve a technical problem but also explain its business value — which helped bridge the frequent gap between analytics and action.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="experience-entry">
      <h3>Electronic Arts — Data Analyst (Contract)</h3>
      <h4>2018 – 2019</h4>
      <p>As a contract data analyst supporting the Madden franchise, I partnered closely with cross-functional teams to deliver actionable insights through data visualization, sentiment analysis, and mentoring. My role bridged the gap between technical data work and business strategy, improving decision-making and player satisfaction.</p>
      
      <h4>Project 1: Stakeholder Dashboard Development & Engagement</h4>
      <ul class="project-1">
        <li>Led end-to-end dashboard projects for key Madden stakeholders by initiating discovery meetings, gathering detailed requirements, and developing interactive prototypes.</li>
        <li>Established a collaborative feedback loop, ensuring stakeholder needs were clearly understood and met on the first iteration—addressing a history of miscommunication with analysts.</li>
        <li>Delivered polished Power BI dashboards that transformed complex datasets into intuitive, actionable insights supporting leadership’s strategic planning and performance tracking.</li>
        <li>Maintained ongoing presentations to stakeholders, fostering transparency and active engagement throughout the development cycle.</li>
      </ul>
      <h4>Project 2: Player Sentiment Analysis from Survey Data</h4>
      <ul class="project-2">
        <li>Collaborated with the customer/player experience team to analyze large-scale player survey data, applying natural language processing techniques to extract sentiment and thematic insights.</li>
        <li>Developed an initial NLP model that quantified positive and negative feedback, revealing key player concerns and satisfaction drivers influencing Madden’s design decisions.</li>
        <li>Provided hands-on playtesting insights as a new Madden player, supplementing quantitative analysis with qualitative feedback to enhance game experience.</li>
        <li>Communicated findings clearly to both technical teams and non-technical stakeholders, driving data-informed improvements.</li>
      </ul>
      <h4>Project 3: Junior Analyst Mentorship & Onboarding</h4>
      <ul class="project-3">
        <li>Created a comprehensive onboarding guide for junior analysts joining the team, standardizing ramp-up procedures and knowledge transfer.</li>
        <li>Delivered targeted SQL training sessions and conducted regular dashboard reviews to elevate team capabilities and maintain data quality.</li>
        <li>Supported junior analyst’s career development through goal-setting discussions and ongoing mentorship in a highly autonomous team environment with minimal managerial oversight.</li>
        <li>Fostered a collaborative culture of learning and continuous improvement despite limited direct supervision.</li> 
      </ul>
